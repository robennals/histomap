# World Power Data Methodology

## Data Sources by Time Period

### Modern Era (1750-2025)
**Source: Maddison Project Database**

For 1750 onwards, GDP estimates come from the Maddison Project Database, which provides PPP-adjusted GDP estimates based on extensive economic historical research.

### Ancient & Medieval Eras (3500 BC - 1750 AD)
**Sources: Scholarly estimates requiring verification**

The pre-1750 data in this visualization represents **rough estimates** that should be treated as illustrative rather than definitive. These estimates draw on several scholarly traditions:

#### Key Academic Sources (for future verification):

1. **Angus Maddison's Historical Estimates**
   - "The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective" (OECD, 2001)
   - Provides GDP estimates back to 1 AD for major regions
   - https://www.oecd.org/dev/theworld economyamillennialperspective.htm

2. **Population-Based Estimates**
   - McEvedy, Colin and Richard Jones. "Atlas of World Population History" (1978)
   - Population is a key proxy for pre-modern economic output

3. **Ancient Economy Research**
   - Scheidel, Walter (ed.). "The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Economy" (2012)
   - Morris, Ian. "The Measure of Civilization" (2013)
   - Provides frameworks for estimating ancient economic output

4. **Regional Studies**
   - Broadberry, Stephen et al. "British Economic Growth 1270-1870" (2015)
   - Broadberry, Stephen et al. "China, Europe and the Great Divergence" (2017)
   - Various papers on Indian, Islamic, and other regional economies

## Bloc Assignments

Countries/regions are assigned to power blocs based on:
- **Political control**: Who governed the territory
- **Economic integration**: Trade relationships and economic dependencies
- **Military influence**: Ability to project power

### Bloc Definitions:

| Bloc | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Mesopotamia | Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian civilizations (until Persian conquest ~539 BC) |
| Egypt | Ancient Egypt (until Roman conquest 30 BC) |
| Persian Empire | Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanid, Safavid empires |
| Greek World | Greek city-states and Hellenistic kingdoms |
| Roman Empire | Roman Republic and Empire (Western) |
| Byzantine Empire | Eastern Roman Empire (330-1453 AD) |
| Islamic Caliphate | Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates |
| Mongol Empire | Mongol Empire at peak (1206-1368) |
| China | Various Chinese dynasties throughout history |
| India | Indian subcontinent under various rulers |
| Ottoman Empire | Ottoman territories (1299-1922) |
| Other European Empires | Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch colonial empires |
| British Empire | British-controlled territories |
| US | United States and territories |
| Russian Empire / USSR | Russian/Soviet sphere of influence |
| NATO + Aligned | Post-WWII Western bloc |
| BRICS + Aligned | Modern emerging economies bloc |
| Other | Regions not under major power influence |

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **Pre-1 AD estimates are highly speculative** - Very limited quantitative data exists for ancient economies

2. **GDP is anachronistic for ancient societies** - Modern economic concepts don't map cleanly to pre-modern economies

3. **"Power" vs. GDP** - Economic output doesn't perfectly correlate with political/military power

4. **Data gaps** - Many regions have sparse historical records

5. **Bloc boundaries are simplified** - Real historical influence was more complex and overlapping
